DESIGN & VISUAL REQUIREMENTS — INSPIRATIONAL + SHAREABLE

You are not just building a UI.
You are designing an emotional artifact people want to pause on, reflect on, and share.

The design must feel:

Calm

Honest

Slightly uncomfortable (in a good way)

Universally relatable

Think: less productivity app, more modern philosophy poster.

1️⃣ Visual Tone & Mood

Keywords (must guide all decisions):

Minimal

Human

Timeless

Quietly confronting

Non-gimmicky

Avoid:

Gamification

Bright startup colors

Progress bars that feel “achievement-based”

Charts that look like dashboards

This is existential clarity, not analytics.

2️⃣ Grid Design (Core Artifact)
Weekly Blocks

Small, square, evenly spaced

Soft edges (slight border-radius)

Past weeks:

Solid, muted fill

Future weeks:

Empty or very light outline

Current week:

Subtle emphasis (slightly darker border or glow)

No animation loops

Color Palette (Guidance)

Neutral tones (off-white, warm gray, charcoal)

1 accent color maximum

No gradients inside the grid

Example feeling:

“This could be framed on a wall.”

3️⃣ Typography
Fonts

Use system fonts or elegant sans-serif

No decorative fonts

No bold overload

Text Hierarchy

Headline: reflective, short

Numbers: clean, understated

No shouting with size or color

4️⃣ Inspirational Copy (Mandatory)

Include at least one short reflective sentence, placed near the grid.

Examples (choose or paraphrase, do not overload):

“Each square is one week of your life.”

“Most of these are already gone.”

“Time is visible when you stop hiding it.”

Rules:

≤ 12 words

Neutral tone

No guilt-tripping

No motivation clichés

5️⃣ Instagram / Social Share Requirements
A. Shareable Layout

Grid + headline + summary must fit inside:

1:1 square

4:5 vertical

Center-aligned composition

Generous whitespace

B. Export Capability

Provide a “Share” or “Export” button

Output:

PNG image

High resolution (min 1080×1080)

No watermarks

No branding unless subtle

C. Privacy

No name required

No birthdate shown explicitly

Only abstract representation

Someone should feel safe sharing this publicly.

6️⃣ Emotional UX Rules

No confetti

No streaks

No “You are X% done!” celebrations

Numbers exist, but visuals lead

The grid should silently do the talking.

7️⃣ Mobile-First Aesthetic

On mobile:

Grid remains readable

Copy does not crowd

Share button reachable with one thumb

Mobile is primary sharing surface, not desktop.

8️⃣ Success Test (Design)

Before finalizing, ask yourself:

Would someone screenshot this unprompted?

Would it feel appropriate on Instagram or Twitter?

Would this still look good printed in black & white?

If yes → ship.

9️⃣ Explicit Design Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO)

❌ Neon colors
❌ Progress trophies
❌ “Optimize your life” language
❌ Startup gradients
❌ Charts pretending to be philosophy

🔚 FINAL DESIGN DIRECTIVE

Design as if this might be the first time someone truly sees time.

Not loud.
Not clever.
Just undeniable.

Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
